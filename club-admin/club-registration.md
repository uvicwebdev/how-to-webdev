## Club Description

> The UVic Web Design and Development Club is a community of students who collaborate and educate each other about all levels of modern web languages and interface design. We enjoy making connections with local companies and start ups through organizing hackathons, meet ups, workshops, and guest talks. We are a great community to hang out with once a week, to learn from each other, and to collaborate on cool projects.
