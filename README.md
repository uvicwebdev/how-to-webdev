# Register with UVSS

**Before the beginning of every semester you wish to be active**, make sure you understand all of the deadlines for below items so you can complete them on time:

- [Register as a returning club](https://uvss.ca/student-groups/clubs/registration-resources/returning-club/), here's some info that might come in handy:
    * Constitution
    * Description
- [Attend the first club council meeting of the semester](https://uvss.ca/student-groups/clubs/)
- [Book a room](http://www.uvic.ca/registrar/students/services/index.php)
   * *If you have a faculty member that can book a room for you before you are ratified, you have a better chance of booking a better room (rooms in ECS book up very quickly)*
   * *If you wind up being too late to book in ECS, Bob Wright Building is a nice back-up plan (nicish projectors, lots of outlets, nicer building, etc)*
