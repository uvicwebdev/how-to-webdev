# Register with UVSS

**Before the beginning of every semester you wish to be active**, make sure you:
- Understand all of the deadlines for below items and plan ahead to get them done

- [Register as a returning club](https://uvss.ca/student-groups/clubs/registration-resources/returning-club/) through an online form. Some information for this form that you will need is:
    * Club Constitution - make sure you skim and update any relevant information, like dates (this was reporpused from the UVic Pets club constitution, so don't sweat the details lul)
    * Club Description (this comes in handy for emailing sponsors and having in your brain for when people ask "wat is webdev")
- [Attend the first club council meeting of the semester](https://uvss.ca/student-groups/clubs/) - DONT MISS THIS (It's how you qualify for the base funding every club automatically gets each semester (ususally ~ $100)
- [Book a room for webdev through an online form](http://www.uvic.ca/registrar/students/services/index.php) (you can only do this once you are 'ratified' by the UVSS for that semester, which usually happens after you submit your returning clubs form or you attend the first clubs council meeting
